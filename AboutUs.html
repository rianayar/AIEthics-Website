        Victoria (17) is an aspiring Aerospace Engineer at South High School in
        Southern California, United States who has always been interested in all
        things STEM. She, as a junior, is in the Pathway Lead the Way:
        Engineering Program, and physics is her favorite subject. This AI Ethics
        Internship, where she worked directly with outstanding like-minded young
        individuals to solve AI bias, has enriched her overall understanding and
        respect for AI ethics. In addition, as someone who is concerned about
        the gender disparities in the STEM field, Victoria is a researcher for
        Sisters of STEM where she actively helps young women find empowerment in
        the field. Because of this passion, it was an honor to work with an
        ‚Äúall-girl‚Äù team, where everyone brought their own experiences and
        expertise to create an intersectional ‚Äúnon‚Äù biased AI system. Victoria
        likes to spend time playing with her dog, shopping with her sister and
        mom, and reading gender theory.
