            While artificial intelligence has started on its rise, so has the
            impact of technology. A wide variety of industries are impacted by
            various devices and algorithms, making it crucial that we consider
            the effects of AI on all these sectors of the economy.

            The biases from AI in the criminal justice system are astounding…
            The current system in place is the “Correctional Offender Management
            Profiling for Alternative Sanctions” or “COMPAS”. It’s main goal is
            to analyze convicts and determine if they are going to offend again,
            and if they are, are they going to be nonviolent or violent
            offenders? On the surface, this seems like a valuable system.
            However, there is low accuracy, especially when it comes to convicts
            of color. For example COMPAS is only 61% effective with reoffending
            nonviolent convicts and 20% effective with reoffending violent
            convicts. 
              With the FAIA, we are hoping to fix the ineffectiveness by
            doing the following: make sure that the program can be corrected for
            bias. There will always be some amount of bias because humans, the
            creators, will always have their own biases. We also plan on using
            humans as a “second check” to make sure there is very limited bias.
            The FAIA will not use any programs until it is as unbiased as
            possible. This will ensure that the biases found in the criminal
            justice system will be kept to a minimum.

            Artificial Intelligence algorithms are popping up throughout the
            education and learning world - especially due to the rise in remote
            learning over the past year. While AI does allow for personalized
            education, the production of smart content, task automation, and
            increased accessibility, it is important to make sure these systems
            are acting with some consciousness as they are interacting with
            people of all ages. Biases are present with regards to intelligence
            levels and different backgrounds and we don’t want algorithms to
            associate certain races, genders, or ages with capabilities. It
            should not make inaccurate and harmful assumptions.

            During recent years, there has been a rapid introduction of AI
            systems into the healthcare sector. Such technologies are taking on
            astounding tasks, ranging from routine chores in medical practice to
            managing patients and medical resources. While these feats are
            impressive, developers must consider the risks associated with the
            mass introduction of these products. Proper government regulation of
            such AI systems can assist in mitigating such risks. AI models use
            data and statistics to train their models to complete given tasks.
            However, lack of accurate and representative data is a problem which
            continues to persist in the healthcare industry. AI systems learn
            from the data on which they are trained. As a result, they can
            incorporate biases from those datasets. For instance, if the data
            available for AI are principally gathered in academic medical
            centers, the resulting AI systems will know less about—and therefore
            will treat less effectively—patients from populations that do not
            typically frequent academic medical centers. Those residing in rural
            areas are therefore systematically unlikely to receive the same
            quality of care as their urban counterparts. Since not all
            healthcare facilities are not all provided with the same resources,
            quality and abundance of data varies starkly from region to region,
            often disenfranchising the less fortunate. In order to counteract
            these issues, our government agency cann push for regulation of
            infrastructural resources within healthcare systems. This would
            provide healthcare systems around the country with means to collect
            accurate and sufficient data A dedicated sector for AI governance
            could also ensure quality oversight of AI products. While the FDA
            does regulate some AI products that are preparing for market entry,
            that does not account for the vast amounts of AI implemented in
            actual healthcare systems like hospitals or clinics. Oversight
            efforts from professional organizations can ensure the quality of
            systems we implement into our daily lives.

            Artificial Intelligence algorithms are constantly used in remote,
            self-driving, and autonomous cars. Driving using machine learning
            has its benefits, but the safety of everyone on the road must be put
            first. We need regulation to ensure that transportation systems are
            rigorously tested and new regulation is put into place for checks
            and balances. Companies need to be held responsible for the
            expensive equipment they are putting out on the road to ensure that
            everyone around the vehicle is still safe.
